# Establishing a Web Developer's Mindset
**ILYES HAMMADI** Full Stack Web Developer, Thursday May 4, 2017, Oran, Algeria.

## A Letter to Myself
**Dear Me,**

I am writing this letter to myself for the future, about **Establishing a Web Developer's Mindset.** It's the last challenge that i still have before graduating from the program, I've been enjoying every single seconds of this program. The udacity team has done an amaizing work with this programs.

When facing a problem you will need to analyze and try to find the problem, if the the problem is a big piece try to split it into small pieces and solve each piece by it’s on. At this moment you’re only a junior web developer but in 3 or 4 years you will achieve the goals and become a software engineer that will work at a big company and help making this world a better place for the next generations.

You will need to never stop learning, never stop believing in your convictions. I am aware that you have found difficulties especially due to the poor education in Algeria, but never forget that life is series of good and bad things so follow the your dreams.

There will be moments when you will face hard problems that will push you your limits, and it will be the chance for you solve them and move forward in life. Will definitely be facing to learn new technologies, don’t be scared of something new, you need to go out of the comfort zone.

And the most important, invest in other people, make as much friends as you can. By doing this at your work or elsewhere you will be surrounded by smart peoples, peoples that cares about you and will push you to the top. Go to local meetups, teach other new coders, meet senior developers, learn from their mistakes. Do pair programming with other developers. And the most important never stop learning.
